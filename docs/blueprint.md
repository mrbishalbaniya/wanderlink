- Interactive Map: Interactive map displaying travel posts as markers using Leaflet.js.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #2E8B57 (Sea Green), a tranquil and inviting hue, reflecting the spirit of travel and exploration.
- Background color: #F0FFF0 (Honeydew), a very light, desaturated shade of the primary color for a clean and airy feel.
- Accent color: #8FBC8F (Dark Sea Green), a slightly darker and more saturated shade to draw attention to interactive elements and key information.
- Body text: 'PT Sans', a versatile sans-serif font, provides excellent readability for post descriptions and user-generated content.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', an elegant serif font, to bring a high-end feel for headers, and small amounts of text; if longer text is anticipated, use 'PT Sans' for body
- Use a consistent set of travel-themed icons from a free library like Font Awesome or Material Design Icons to represent different travel categories (hiking, city, beach, etc.).
- Emphasize a clean and intuitive layout, prioritizing the interactive map and ensuring easy navigation for post creation and exploration.
